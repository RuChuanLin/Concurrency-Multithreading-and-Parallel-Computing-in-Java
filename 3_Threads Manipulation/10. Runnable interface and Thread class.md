# Runnable interface and Thread class


In the previous lectures we've seen that we can create threads either with **Runnable interfaces** or with **Thread classes**. You may pose the question: what approach to prefer?

**Usually using the Runnable interface approach is preferred.**

- if we extends Thread then we canâ€™t extend any other class (usually a huge diasvantage) because in Java a given class can extends one class exclusively

- a class may implement more interfaces as well - so implementing the Runnable interface can do no harm in the software logic (now or in the future)
