# 19. What is the difference between wait and sleep?

Let's discuss the difference between `sleep` and `wait`. They may seem to be very similar but there are fundamental differences between them.

- you call `wait` on the **Object** while on the other hand you call `sleep` on the **Thread** itself

- `wait` can be interrupter (this is why we need the InterruptedException) while on the other hand `sleep` can not

- `wait` (and notify) must happen in a synchronized  block on the monitor object whereas `sleep` does not

- `sleep` operation does not release the locks it holds while on the other hand `wait` releases the lock on the object that `wait()` is called on

So as you can see there are some differences between wait and sleep operations!
