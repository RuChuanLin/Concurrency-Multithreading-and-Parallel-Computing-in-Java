# 17. What are re-entrant locks?

In the previous lectures we have been talking about locks (intrinsic locks or monitor locks).

- there is a single intrinsic lock associated with every object or class in Java

- a given  thread that needs exclusive and consistent access to an object's fields

- has to acquire the object's intrinsic lock before accessing them,

- and then the thread releases the intrinsic lock when it's done with them

- with Locks: the acquired lock can be released any thread

- RLocks can be released by the thread that acquired it exclusively

Ok so a thread cannot acquire a lock owned by another thread. But a given thread can acquire a lock that it already owns. **Allowing a thread to acquire the same lock more than once is called re-entrant synchronization**. And this is exactly what is happening in Python when using RLocks- the same thread may acquire the lock more than once.

For example: let's consider recursive method calls. If a given thread calls a recursive and synchronized method several times then it is fine (note that in this case the same thread "enters" the synchronized block several times). There will be no deadlock because of re-entrant synchronization.
