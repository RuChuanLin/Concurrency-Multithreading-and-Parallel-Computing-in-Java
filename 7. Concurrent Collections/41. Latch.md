# 41. Latch


This is used to synchronize one or more tasks by forcing them to wait for the completion of a set of operations being performed by other tasks.

- You give an nubmer to initilize a CountDownLatch object, and any tasks can call await(). The object will block until the count reaches zero.
- Other tasks may call countDown() on the object to reduce the count, presumably it finishes its job.
- a CountDownLatch -> the count can not be reset.
  - if you need a version that resets the count, use cyclicBarrier instead.
- the tasks that call countDown() are not blocked when they make that call.
    only those who call await() will be blocked until the count reaches 0.

A typical use is to divide a problem into N indepndently solvable tasks and create a CountDownLatch with a value of N

When each task finish their jobs, call countDown() on the latch . Tasks waiting for the problems to be solved call wait() on the latch to hold themselves back until its completed.

For example, you want to trigger something after 10000 users doadload an image!!
