# 42. Cyclic barrier

Latch : multiple thread can wait for each other

A CyclicBarrier is used in situations where you want to create a group of tasks to perform work in parallel + wait until they are all finished before moving to the next step

    - something like join()
    - something like CountDownLatch()

- CountDownLatch : one-shot event
- CyclicBarrier : it can be reused over and over again


CyclicBarrier has a barrier action : a runnable, that will run automatically when the count reaches 0!!

```java
new CyclicBarrier(N) // N threads will wait for each other
```

WE CAN NOT REUSE LATCH BUT WE CAN REUSE CyclicBarrier -> reset()!!

它和 Latch 看起來很像, 但其實我覺得應用場景不同。

需要再查一下差別。
